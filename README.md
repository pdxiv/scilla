This is an attempt to write some code to support games compatible with The Quill adventure game system on ZX Spectrum and other platforms.

## Hopes and dreams

* Should be able to play back game files, including original custom characters and graphics using the Fyne toolkit
* Should be able to graphically edit games using the Fyne toolkit
* Should support multiple target platforms

## Current status

Code isn't doing much
